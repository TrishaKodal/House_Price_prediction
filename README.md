# House_Price_prediction
Aim

To predict the sale prices of the houses and improve the log error i.e. the error due to the difference between the actual and the predicted home values.

Duplicate value removal
Missing value imputation
Rescaling of incorrectly scaled data
Standardization
Encoding of categorical variables
Generation of new feature wherever required.
Dropping of redundant feature columns
Checking for multi-collinearity and removal of highly correlated features
Check for the outliners and removal of outliers.
